**Title: Unsupervised Learning: An Insight Into Its Evolution, Key Ideas, Variations, and Applications**

**1. Introduction**
Unsupervised learning is among the most intriguing facets of Machine Learning. Unlike Supervised Learning that depends on labelled data, Unsupervised Learning insists on exploring hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in unlabelled data. This leverages the artificial intelligence (AI) to function on its own cognition, opening a broad spectrum of potential applications in numerous fields. It's a stepping stone towards self-reliant AI systems that can reason and learn from their own experiences.

**2. History**
The concept of Unsupervised Learning has been shaping the machine learning landscape since the late 20th Century. During the 1960s and 1970s, statistical theories for unsupervised learning began to emerge. In the subsequent decades, computational algorithms developed, fostering significant advancement in unsupervised learning techniques. Conversational AI, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems of the 21st Century owe much of their progress to these formative years.

**3. Key Ideas**
Unsupervised learning comprises two fundamental approaches: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction. Clustering is an exploratory data analysis technique that categorizes unlabelled data into distinctive 'clusters' based on intrinsic similarities. Dimensionality Reduction, on the other hand, simplifies the high-dimensional data while retaining its significant features. This simplification enables the understanding of complex data relationships, data visualization, and improves machine learning model performance.

**4. Variations**
A plethora of variations on unsupervised learning techniques exists, each tailored for different data types and scenarios. Some examples are K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering under the ‘clustering’ umbrella. Methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) make for common dimensionality reduction techniques. Another significant variant is Generative Models like the Autoencoders (AEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that generate new data instances resembling the original data.

**5. Applications**
Unsupervised Learning finds diverse applications globally. In healthcare, it streamlines medical diagnostics and enables predictive modeling. In the business sphere, it commends itself in customer segmentation, market research, and recommendation systems. Unsupervised learning also finds application in the detection of abnormal activities, cybersecurity, natural language processing, and image and speech recognition. Moreover, it's an invaluable tool in autonomous vehicles, creating self-driven systems that learn from the environment.
