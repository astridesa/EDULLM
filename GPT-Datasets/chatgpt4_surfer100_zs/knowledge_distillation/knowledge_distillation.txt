**Introduction**

Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a cutting-edge approach in the field of machine learning, where the knowledge contained in an elaborate and detailed network model, often referred to as the teacher network, is transferred to a smaller, more compact network model known as the student network. KD is valuable because it provides high-performance models with lower computational demands, thus facilitating tasks such as real-time processing and deployment on devices with fewer computational resources, such as mobile phones and other Edge devices. 

**History**

Knowledge Distillation was initially introduced by Hinton et al. in 2015. While the notion of learning from larger models is not new, KD stood out because of its unique approach - learning from soft probabilities (probabilities from softer-max outputs) generated by the teacher model. This method proved significantly better than traditional forms of model compression or simple training, leading to wider acceptance in the machine learning community. Over time, multiple variations came into existence, further extending the utility and applicability of KD.

**Key Ideas**

The core principal of Knowledge Distillation is to train a less complex student model to imitate the behavior of a more complex teacher model. The student learns from the softened output of the teacher model, which contains more information about the data distribution compared to hard labels. A KD trained model can be more competent than one trained on the original dataset labels because this process ensures the student model absorbs the teacher model's generalization capabilities and implicit knowledge in data representation.  

**Variations**

Since the inception of Knowledge Distillation, several variants have been proposed. One notable variation is 'Self-Distillation', where the same model plays the role of both student and teacher over multiple rounds of training. Another variant is 'Multi-Teacher Distillation', which leverages multiple teacher models to improve the student model's performance. 'Relational KD' is another novel approach where the student learns the teacher's sample-wise relations rather than output probabilities. Each of these variations offers different advantages based on the specific use case.

**Applications**

Knowledge Distillation is of primary value in situations where computational resources are limited. It is extensively used to deploy machine learning models on Edge devices with minimal memory or computational resources like smartphones or Internet-of-Things (IoT) gadgets. It is also finding applications in enhancing the performance of reinforcement learning agents and ensuring AI models remain interpretable and accessible, thereby making it an indispensable tool in the AI industry.
