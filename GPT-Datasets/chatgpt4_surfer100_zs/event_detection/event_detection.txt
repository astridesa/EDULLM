Title: Event Detection - A Comprehensive Review 

1. Introduction
Event detection is a key discipline within data analysis, primarily focused on identifying meaningful patterns and occurrences within a vast pool of data points. The objective of event detection is to uncover incidences that diverge from normative patterns, revealing imperative insights for various sectors including security, health, environment, and market research. This process aids in real-time monitoring and response, as well as strategic planning and decision making, thus identifying these critical incidences faster and more efficiently.

2. History
The field of event detection emerged through advances in computer science and data analytics. Early forms initiated in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the development of Intelligent Alarm Processors and Monitoring Systems. The internet era stimulated rapid advancements in event detection, as ‘big data’ became an ever-growing resource. Tools such as CUSUM charts and EWMA algorithms were developed in the early 2000s to detect anomalies in network traffic. Today, sophisticated AI-based approaches have proliferated, leading to fast and accurate detection of a multitude of events.

3. Key Ideas
Event detection hinges on a few pivotal concepts. Firstly, an event is a meaningful occurrence that stands out from the typical pattern of data. This distinction leads to the second key idea: anomalies or outliers. These divergent data points could indicate an event. The third key concept is real-time detection; event detection systems often need to identify events as they occur, to enable immediate response. Lastly, machine learning, particularly deep learning algorithms, plays a significant role in modern approaches to event detection, adding a predictive capacity to the process.

4. Variations
Event detection varies based on the type of data and application. In time-series data, change point detection is used to identify sudden shifts over time. In the case of spatial data, spatial event detection finds anomalous clusters in a geographical context. For security applications, intrusion detection systems identify potential threats. Predictive event detection applies machine learning to forecast future occurrences. These varied approaches cater to unique requirements of different domains.

5. Applications
The applications of event detection span across many sectors. In environmental science, it aids in identifying natural disasters like earthquakes or floods. In health sector, it assists in detecting disease outbreaks. For financial markets, it helps identify sudden market shifts. Security systems employ event detection to spot suspicious activity. In the realm of social media, it is used to identify trending topics, and in infrastructure, it helps identify system faults. Thus, event detection serves as a vital tool in various domains, assisting in swift and effective decision-making processes.
