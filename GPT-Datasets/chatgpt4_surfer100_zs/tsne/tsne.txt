Title: An Overview of t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

I. Introduction (92 words)
The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a revolutionary machine learning algorithm utilized for visualization of high-dimensional data sets. Conceived by Geoffrey Hinton and Laurens van der Maaten in 2008, t-SNE reduces dimensions while preserving the relationships or similarity between the datapoints. It has transformed data visualization by providing an intuitive approach by which humans can perceive complex, highly-dimensional data in a way that preservers similarity in simple two-dimensional scatter plots.

II. History (77 words)
In 2002, Geoffrey Hinton and Sam Roweis originally developed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE). However, in 2008, Laurens van der Maaten and Hinton drew improvements on the SNE, giving birth to the superior t-SNE. The aim was to solve the problems of the original SNE, including the “crowding problem” where dimensional reduction from high to lower ones could lead to overlapping datapoints. The t-SNE proved to be a significant upgrade over the traditional SNE.

III. Key Ideas (131 words)
The t-SNE method works by converting the high-dimensional Euclidean distances between datapoints into conditional probabilities, mimicking a Gaussian distribution. These probabilities quantify pairwise similiarities of the input objects. For the low-dimensional counterparts, a t-distribution is used instead. To settle the final positions of the data points, t-SNE minimizes the divergence between the two distributions with gradient descent. Its major innovation is the utilization of a Student's t-distribution instead of a Gaussian function to compute the similarity between two points in the lower dimensional space. This results in a more effective model for distant points and mitigates the crowding problem, consequently, ensuring a more representative, high-quality visualization of high-dimensional data.

IV. Variations (86 words)
Various enhancements on t-SNE are proposed, including: (1) the Barnes-Hut algorithm to accelerate t-SNE making it scalable to larger datasets; (2) parametric t-SNE in which a neural network is trained to approximate the t-SNE mapping, permitting quicker processing of new datapoints; and (3) largeVis, another variant, which yields similar results as t-SNE but is more suitable for extremely large datasets. 

V. Applications (73 words)
t-SNE has significant applications across multiple disciplines. It's widely used in data analysis to visually inspect high-dimensional data in fields like machine learning, bioinformatics for gene expression analyses and single-cell sequencing, and image processing. Additionally, in the neuroscience field, it has been employed for data-driven behavioral analyses. t-SNE's capabilities to simplify, analyze, and represent high-dimensional data make it an invaluable tool in our data abundant world.
