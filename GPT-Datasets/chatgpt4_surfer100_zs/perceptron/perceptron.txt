**1. Introduction**

Perceptron is a fundamental machine learning approach for binary classifiers. It is a linear model that makes predictions based on a linear prediction function, combining a set of weights with the feature vector. Initially used for simple recognition tasks, its application scope expanded with the understanding of its capabilities. At its core, Perceptron is a simplistic, yet versatile algorithm that finds application in diverse fields, shaping the basis of complex deep learning models.

**2. History**

The Perceptron concept was first introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. His initial concept was an algorithm for pattern recognition based on a two-layer network. In the 1960s, the perceptron model faced a severe setback with Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert's book "Perceptron," emphasizing its limitations. However, advancements in technology in the 1980s, due to the advent of multi-layer perceptrons, allowed for the learning of non-linear functions, reviving interest in this area.

**3. Key Ideas**

The Perceptron is based on a simple idea: the algorithm accepts a binary input dataset and returns a single binary output. It assigns weights to the feature inputs and adjusts these values in the learning phase. If the output is incorrect, the weights are tunned. This process continues until the Perceptron algorithm produces the correct output or reaches a predefined number of iterations. The weight modification process employs the Perceptron learning rule, ensuring the convergence of the learning process.

**4. Variations**

There have been several modifications to the basic Perceptron algorithm to counter its limitations and enhance its functionality. Notably, the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) was developed to deal with the inability of the single-layer perceptron in solving non-linear problems. MLP consists of one or more intermediate layers, drastically improving Perceptron's power by learning more complicated decision boundaries. 

**5. Applications**

Despite its simplicity, the Perceptron algorithm finds vast applications across various fields. It plays a critical role in deep learning and neural networks, acting as a building block for complex models. Modern applications include Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, computer vision, and more. Further, its simplicity and ease of use make it ideal for educational purposes, providing a pathway for students learning machine learning principles.
