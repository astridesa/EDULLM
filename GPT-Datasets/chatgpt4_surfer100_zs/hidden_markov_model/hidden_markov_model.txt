**Introduction**

The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model often used in data analysis and pattern recognition. It assumes data as a Markov process with unknown parameters, and the challenge is determining the hidden parameters from the observable data. In essence, HMM is a simple abstract machine that works in a series of states and can 'memorize' certain aspects of the past. It is 'hidden' because we can't directly observe the states; we can only see the outcome. Given the input data, HMM can infer the likely sequence of states.

**History**

Russian mathematician Andrey Markov introduced the Markov chains to science at the start of the 20th century. However, the concept of hidden states was first formulated by researchers at the Institute for Signal and Information Processing in the 1960s and '70s. Primarily used for speech recognition technology, the concept remains in use today in many applications. Statistical dermatoglyphics, automated speech and handwriting recognition, bioinformatics, and information extraction from text are a few areas where HMM has excelled.

**Key Ideas**

The underlying mechanism of HMM involves a series of observable outputs and a sequence of hidden states where these outcomes occur. The three fundamental problems HMM tries to solve are: likelihood computation (evaluating the probability of an observation sequence), decoding (finding the best hidden state sequence), and learning (adapting model parameters for maximum likelihood). These problems are addressed using the Forward-Backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, and the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm respectively.

**Variations**

Several variations of HMM have been developed to address different problems. For example, the Input-Output HMM (IOHMM) model is used where both state and observation sequences are of interest, making it applicable to supervised learning problems. The Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) features strongly coupled chains, suitable for synchronised time series such as video and speech processing. The Variable Length Markov Model (VLMM) is another variant offering greater flexibility and efficiency in handling specific types of pattern recognition tasks.

**Applications**

HMM has a wide range of applications, from bioinformatics to linguistics. In computational biology, HMM is used in gene prediction and protein alignment. In speech processing, HMM is employed in speech recognition and synthesis systems. In natural language processing, it's extensively used for tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and information extraction. In finance, HMMs are used for system risk assessments and predictions. Additionally, they are applied in computer vision to detect and predict activities.
