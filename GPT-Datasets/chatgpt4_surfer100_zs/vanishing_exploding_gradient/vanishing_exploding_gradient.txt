Title: Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: Emergence, Insights, Transformations, and Applications

I. Introduction
Vanishing and Exploding Gradients are prominent issues within the domain of deep learning, significantly affecting the performance of models. Essentially, during the training process, deep learning models use a method called backpropagation to adjust parameters in line with the gradient, or slope, of the loss function. However, these gradients can become exceedingly small (vanish) or extremely large (explode), convoluting and slowing down this adjustment process. The resulting unstable network then impedes accurate learning and prediction, creating a barrier to model optimization.

II. History
The issues of Vanishing and Exploding gradients first surfaced in the early 1990s, firmly tethered to the burgeoning field of deep learning. In 1991, Hochreiter's German diploma thesis referenced the vanishing gradient problem, which was later formally outlined in the 1994 paper, "Gradient Flow in Recurrent Nets: the Difficulty of Learning Long-Term Dependencies". The related concept of exploding gradients was subsequently identified as another side of the coin, occurring under different conditions but causing equally disruptive effects on model training.

III. Key Ideas
At their core, Vanishing and Exploding Gradients stem from the practice of backpropagation. Primarily associated with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the problem arises as gradients are passed back through many layers during network training. When these layers use activation functions such as sigmoid or tanh, mathematical operations can cause these gradients to vanish or explode. Both problems interfere with the correct weight adjustments, either by making changes negligibly small with vanishing gradients or overly volatile with exploding gradients.

IV. Variations
Several variations have been developed to mitigate the Vanishing and Exploding Gradients problems. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units were introduced to combat vanishing gradients in RNNs. Weight initialization techniques, like Xavier and He, also proved to regulate the initial weight magnitudes hence preventing extreme gradients. Another common solution involves replacing traditional activation units with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Further, batch normalization and gradient clipping are also used to control the magnitude of gradients.

V. Applications
Understanding and addressing the Vanishing and Exploding Gradients issues often equates to more efficient and effective deep learning models, impacting a wide array of applications. Key areas include natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition, where RNNs and other deep learning architectures play a central role. Moreover, these techniques have facilitated advancements in machine translation, automated driving, and even synthesizing art, underlining the importance of resolving these challenges and the depth of their applicability.
