**INTRODUCTION**

Meta-Learning, commonly known as "learning to learn", is an emerging subfield in Machine Learning. It presents a paradigm that aims at understanding the strategies required to design and implement algorithms which can adapt to new tasks swiftly with scarce data. Rather than training a model using extensive computational resources, meta-learning utilizes knowledge from prior tasks to address new problems, providing a more efficient and effective learning process. This process parallels how humans apply their innate intelligence in adapting to diversified learning experiences.

**HISTORY**

Meta-learning traces back to the mid-20th century with psychologists such as Jean Piaget investigating innate capabilities to learn. However, in the context of artificial intelligence, meta-learning emerged in the late 20th century. Early contributions like Thrun and Pratt's book "Learning to Learn" and Schmidhuber's work "On Learning How to Learn Learning Strategies" have been influential in shaping the field. Interest in meta-learning significantly grew in the 2010s with advancements in neural networks and the availability of massive amounts of data.

**KEY IDEAS**

The core idea of meta-learning is to design models that can learn quickly when presented with new tasks. This involves two levels of learning: the initial learning phase, called 'meta-training', where the model learns across a range of tasks, and the second phase, called 'meta-testing' or 'adaptation', where the model applies its learned knowledge to new, unseen tasks. There are three primary strategies in meta-learning: metric-based, model-based, and optimization-based learning. These trailblazing methodologies allow models to share knowledge across tasks, tune models more effectively, and even learn optimization algorithms.

**VARIATIONS**

The variations in meta-learning techniques generally center on the approach to learning and problem complexity. Among them, few-shot learning targets tasks with restricted data, leveraging experiences from other learning episodes. Transfer learning uses knowledge gathered from one task to improve performance on a different related task. Finally, lifelong learning embodies the ultimate goal of meta-learning - creating models that continually learn and adapt over time, much like human learning.

**APPLICATIONS**

Meta-learning has numerous applications ranging from natural language processing, computer vision to healthcare. By utilizing the principles of meta-learning, models can better handle tasks with minimal data like image recognition or language translation. In healthcare, it has the potential to personalize medical treatment or diagnosis by leveraging past patient data. Most recently, it has been applied in reinforcement learning, where its strategies have been used to train AI agents to adapt to new environments faster. Overall, meta-learning paves the way for more efficient and intelligent AI systems.
