Title: Vanishing Exploding Gradient: A Survey on its Introduction, History, Key Ideas, Variations, and Applications

Introduction:
The vanishing exploding gradient problem is a significant challenge in deep learning, which arises when gradients become too large or too small during the training process. This survey article provides an overview of this issue, discussing its implications and potential solutions.

History:
The vanishing exploding gradient problem was first identified in the late 1980s. It was introduced by Sepp Hochreiter, who observed that traditional gradient-based optimization algorithms struggle when dealing with deep neural networks. The research of Hochreiter and others laid the foundation for understanding the problem and finding ways to mitigate its effects.

Key Ideas:
To address the vanishing exploding gradient problem, various techniques have been proposed. One key idea is the use of activation functions and weight initialization methods that prevent the gradients from growing too large or too small. Another important concept is the introduction of skip connections, such as in residual neural networks, to allow for more efficient gradient flow through the network.

Variations:
Over the years, several variations of the vanishing exploding gradient problem have been identified. These include the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which are specifically designed to handle recurrent neural networks by using gating mechanisms to control the gradient flow. Other variations include gradient clipping, batch normalization, and optimized weight initialization techniques.

Applications:
The vanishing exploding gradient problem has significant implications in various fields where deep learning is applied. This problem affects the training process of deep neural networks, such as in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Understanding and addressing this problem is crucial for improving the performance and convergence of deep learning systems in these applications.

In conclusion, the vanishing exploding gradient problem poses a challenge in deep learning, but with the advancement in techniques and methodologies, its effects can be mitigated. This survey article covered the introduction, history, key ideas, variations, and applications related to this problem. By understanding and addressing this issue, researchers and practitioners can further enhance the performance and reliability of deep learning models across various domains.
