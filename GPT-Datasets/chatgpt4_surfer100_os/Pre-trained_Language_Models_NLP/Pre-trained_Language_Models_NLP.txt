<INTRODUCTION>
Pre-trained Language Models are a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that utilize pre-existing models to comprehend and analyze linguistic patterns. These models are trained on large datasets, designed to capture a broad spectrum of language constructs and nuances. They have the capacity to understand context, extract meaning, and answer queries accurately, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. The efficacy of these models in natural language understanding tasks has revolutionized the NLP field with advanced processing capabilities.

<HISTORY>
The concept of pre-trained language models in NLP emerged from the necessity to better understand and process human languages. Since the early 2010s, several pre-training language models have been developed. Notably, the Word2Vec model by Google in 2013, GloVe by Stanford in 2014, and later models like OpenAI's Transformer-based GPT, and Google's BERT, which became popular for their extensive pre-training abilities. The evolution has been largely focused on improving model size, pre-training strategies, and capabilities.

<KEY IDEAS>
Pre-trained language models rely on two key principles: feature-based and fine-tuning approaches. Feature-based approaches, like Word2Vec and GloVe, use pre-training to learn a standalone feature extract, used in downstream tasks. On the other hand, fine-tuning approaches, like BERT and GPT, learn generalized representations during pre-training and are fine-tuned on specific tasks. Also noteworthy is the shift towards Transformer models, which simplify architecture and improve performance. By handling data sparsity, understanding context and enabling scalability, these models have significantly influenced recent strides in NLP.

<VARIATIONS>
Several variations of pre-trained language models have been developed over the years. These vary in their training approaches, objectives, and size. Some popular variations include GPT by OpenAI, designed to generate human-like text; BERT by Google, which reads the entire sequence of words for better understanding context; and RoBERTa, a robust optimized version of BERT. Other models like XLNet, ALBERT, and T5 have introduced unique aspects like permutation-based training and multilingual capabilities. 

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
The applications of pre-trained language models in NLP are vast. They are used in machine translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and question answering systems among others. These models have been incorporated into various industries such as healthcare for medical transcriptions and diagnoses, law for legal document analysis, education for automated grading and tutoring, customer service for automated chatbots, and even entertainment for content generation. Their ability to comprehend, interpret, and generate human language makes them a valuable asset in our increasingly digital world.
