<INTRODUCTION>
Dropout Neural Networks are a simple yet highly impactful regularization technique for reducing overfitting in neural networks. Introduced by Hinton et al., in 2012, this method provides an effective way to combine many different neural network architectures efficiently. Dropout refers to randomly "dropping out," i.e., ignoring or turning off, neurons during the training process. This strategy helps in making the model more robust and prevents reliance on any particular neuron thus enhancing the overall performance of the neural network.

<HISTORY>
Dropout Neural Networks were first introduced by Geoffrey Hinton, Nitish Srivastava, and their colleagues from the University of Toronto in 2012. Hinton, widely recognized as the "godfather of deep learning," aimed to prevent overfitting in complex neural networks. He proposed that randomly silencing a subset of neurons during training would introduce noise into the system and force the network to learn more robust features. This method quickly attracted significant attention in the field, demonstrating great efficacy in improving the generalization capacity of neural networks.

<KEY IDEAS>
Dropout Neural Networks operate by "dropping out" a random portion of neurons in each training iteration. This means that each neuron has a certain probability of being temporarily removed or its contribution set to zero during part of the training. By performing this operation, the network becomes, in essence, an ensemble of smaller, thinner networks with shared weights. This approach not only helps in reducing overfitting but also improves network performance. While the original paper suggested a dropout rate of 50%, this parameter can be tuned according to specific needs of the application.

<VARIATIONS>
Over the years, multiple variations of the dropout technique have been proposed to improve its functionality. For instance, Spatial Dropout extends the basic dropout concept to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is applied to the feature map to improve robustness of the model. Another variation, Alpha Dropout, is specifically designed for Self-Normalizing Neural Networks (SNNs). It preserves the mean and the variance of the input to ensure self-normalization property is not lost. In addition, DropConnect modifies the architecture so that random weights, instead of neurons, are dropped during training.

<APPLICATIONS>
Dropout method has broad applications in various domains of deep learning. It is notably used in image recognition and classification tasks where overfitting can be a common issue due to high dimensionality of data. Furthermore, dropout has been beneficially applied in natural language processing tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and language generation. Recently, it has also been applied in the area of reinforcement learning to improve the robustness and reliability of the learned policy. Dropout, therefore, has significantly contributed to the increased accuracy and effectiveness of several complex neural network models.
