<INTRODUCTION>
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have emerged as a powerful means for machine learning on data structured as graphs. A GCN is a type of convolutional network that operates directly on graphs. As graphs naturally represent generic relationships between objects, they offer a flexible structure for data representation. They have demonstrated impressive performance in various tasks including classification, link prediction, and graph embedding. GCNs can efficiently capture the global properties of the graph and can learn meaningful node representations by considering the graph's connectivity structure and the nodes’ feature vectors. 

<HISTORY>
GCNs are an evolution of handy ideas from graph theory and convolutional neural networks (CNN). In 2016, Thomas Kipf and Max Welling published a seminal paper titled "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks", introducing the concept of GCNs. They stemmed from the need to process data not naturally accommodated in Euclidean spaces or grids, which is the typical input data form for conventional neural networks. The idea was to generalize convolutional operations to handle irregular grids in non-Euclidean domains, effectively extending Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to work on graph data. 

<KEY IDEAS>
The core idea behind GCNs is to generalize the convolution operation from image processing to arbitrary graphs. This involves aggregating the feature information from all neighbors for each node in the graph and combining it with the node’s own features. The result is a new set of feature vectors that captures local connectivity patterns. A layer in a GCN processes all nodes in the graph simultaneously, resulting in an output feature at each node that represents the local neighborhood and node features. Stacking several such layers enables the model to capture higher-level patterns in the graph. 

<VARIATIONS>
Several variants of GCNs have been proposed to address different challenges in graph learning tasks. Some notable examples include GraphSAGE, Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and ChebNet. GraphSAGE is designed to create embeddings for nodes in large graphs, extending GCN to handle large-scale and inductive learning scenarios. GAT introduces the concept of attention mechanisms to learn the weights of neighbors, empowering the model to focus on the most informative parts of the graph. ChebNet extends GCN by considering a larger receptive field, using a spectral formulation which is in contrast to the spatial formulation of GCNs. 

<APPLICATIONS>
GCNs have been used successfully in a broad range of applications, including bioinformatics, social network analysis, and recommendation systems. In bioinformatics, GCNs can be used to establish drug responses and predict protein interfaces. In social network analysis, GCNs can be used to detect communities and predict social ties. In recommendation systems, GCN can be used to make personalized recommendations by modeling the user-item interaction graph.
