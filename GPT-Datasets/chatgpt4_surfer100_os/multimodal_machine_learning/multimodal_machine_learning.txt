<INTRODUCTION>
Multimodal Machine Learning is an emerging discipline in artificial intelligence which explores the integration and interpretation of multiple data types, including text, speech, video, and images. This approach conducts the computational models that address information from different modalities, striving to exploit the correlations between them for improved learning accuracy and robustness. It represents the evolution from uni-modal learning models and has gained considerable attention due to the massive amounts of multimodal data available via social media, autonomous vehicles, and other resources. 

<HISTORY>
The origin of multimodal machine learning can be traced back to earlier research on multi-sensor data fusion which was conducted in the 1990s and early 2000s. This was primarily aimed at military applications, but the idea was eventually applied to civilian uses like healthcare and telecommunications. It was around 2010 that the machine learning community began focusing on developing algorithms capable of processing and learning from multiple modalities simultaneously.

<KEY IDEAS>
The key ideas in multimodal machine learning involve processing and integrating different types of data to improve learning. This includes techniques like data fusion, where different data types are combined early in the process, and late fusion, where data types are processed separately and the results are then combined. The use of ensemble methods, employing multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance, is also common in this field. Various deep learning architectures like multimodal autoencoders and recurrent neural networks are implemented, these are capable of learning complex patterns from multimodal data.

<VARIATIONS>
Different variations of multimodal machine learning include cross-modal learning, which focuses on learning the correspondence between different modalities for the purpose of translating information from one modality to another; multi-view learning, where various perspectives/views of the same data are leveraged; and multi-task learning, which shares information across related tasks to improve generalization. The degree to which the modalities are integrated can also vary, from early fusion of modalities to late fusion, where integration happens after individual modalities are processed.

<APPLICATIONS>
Applications of multimodal machine learning are widespread and diverse. They range from surveillance systems that interpret and respond to visual, audio and sensor data, to healthcare applications that analyze a variety of data like patient records, diagnostic images, and genomics data to predict disease progression. Other applications include autonomous driving, which relies on multimodal data like camera feeds, lidar, and radar signals for navigation decisions; and social media analysis, where text, images and user interaction data are analyzed to gain insights about user behavior.
