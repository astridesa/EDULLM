<INTRODUCTION>
Logic and Logical Agents are foundational concepts in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Logic is a formal mathematical system that represents statements or assertions, facilitating sound reasoning. Logical Agents, by extension, are intelligent entities that possess a knowledge base, constructed via logical expressions, and utilize inference methods to make rational decisions. Logical reasoning remains a powerful tool for AI, permitting machines to understand complex relationships, solve intricate problems and make decisions based on facts and rules. The insights generated from logical reasoning have broad applications in areas like computer science, philosophy, mathematics, cognitive science, and linguistics. 

<HISTORY>
The concept of logic dates back to the classical period of ancient Greece, with philosophers like Aristotle who championed formal logic as a crucial component of rational thought. However, the application of logic in AI kicked off during the advent of computing in the mid-20th century. Alan Turing's pioneering work laid out the theoretical basis for digital computers capable of logical inference. Subsequent research introduced languages like Prolog, and concepts such as Logic Programming, which became instrumental in the development of Logical Agents.

<KEY IDEAS>
The key idea behind Logic and Logical Agents lies in representing information in a formal, logical language, through which inference methods can be applied to deduce new information or make decisions. Firstly, a language for expressing assertions about the world is required. This is followed by a formal system of logic, which defines how conclusions are drawn from these assertions. Different forms of logic, like propositional logic, predicate logic, or modal logic, allow various levels of expressiveness and complexity.

<VARIATIONS>
There are various types of logical systems used in AI, each with distinct expressiveness and computational properties. Propositional logic, the simplest form, deals with propositions that are either true or false. Predicate logic introduces variables and quantifiers, allowing more complex expressions. Modal logic includes additional operators representing concepts like necessity and possibility. Furthermore, each type of logic can be applied in different reasoning methods, such as forward chaining, backward chaining, and resolution, providing different strategies for inference.

<APPLICATIONS>
Logic and Logical Agents have been applied in various domains. In Expert Systems, they are used to embody explicit knowledge and provide deductions. In the field of natural language understanding, logic provides a formalism for representing semantic information.  Logic-based planning systems use logical representations to reason about actions and changes in the world. In databases, logic provides foundations for query languages. Logical Agents also provide infrastructure for autonomous agents and multi-agent systems, which are widely used in computer games, e-commerce, and computational sociology.
