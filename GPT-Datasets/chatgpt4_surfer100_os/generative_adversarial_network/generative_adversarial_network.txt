<INTRODUCTION>
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are innovative algorithms in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning. Invented by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014, GANs provide a way of training generative models that produce new data instances resembling a given dataset. By setting up a 'game' between two neural networks â€“ a generative network that creates the instances and a discriminative network that evaluates them - GANs manipulate the generation process, leading to the creation of impressively realistic images, sounds and texts.

<HISTORY>
Devised by Ian Goodfellow and his research team in 2014, the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks revolutionized the deep learning landscape. GANs introduced a novel twist to the traditional generative models by deploying a two-agent system - a generator and a discriminator - playing a competitive game. Goodfellow's idea originated from his thoughts on two-player games and the economics of counterfeit and ant-counterfeit systems. This notion has since triggered an explosion of research with GANs being employed in many artificial intelligence tasks.

<KEY IDEAS>
GANs function through a strategic game setup between two neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator's purpose is to mimic the real data distribution to produce fake data while the discriminator aims to distinguish real data from fake ones. The generator continually learns to create better fakes through the feedback from the discriminator, which simultaneously improves its ability to differentiate. The iterative training continues until the discriminator cannot distinguish real and fake data. The adversarial nature of this learning process gives GANs their name and unique power.

<VARIATIONS>
There are many variations of GANs, including conditional GANs, CycleGANs, ProGAN, and StyleGANs. Conditional GANs allow the generation of data with specified attributes by feeding additional information to both networks. CycleGANs employ two generative networks and their associated discriminators to translate images from one class to another. ProGAN gradually upscales the generated images, improving the structural coherence and detail level. Lastly, StyleGANs provide fine control over the style of generated images at different scales. Each variation extends the basic GANs concept to fulfill specific applications.

<APPLICATIONS>
GANs have found significant applications in various fields. In image synthesis, GANs can generate extraordinarily realistic images, even HD-quality faces of non-existent humans. They are potent tools in improving image resolution quality, known as super-resolution, and performing image-to-image translation tasks (e.g., transforming sketches into colored images). GANs are also making strides in voice generation and text to image synthesis. Regarding future applications, GANs hold serious potential for virtual reality, gaming and even drug discovery, shaping the future of artificial intelligence.
