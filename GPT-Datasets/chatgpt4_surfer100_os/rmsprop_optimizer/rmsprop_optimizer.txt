<INTRODUCTION>
RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) optimizer is a widely used gradient descent optimization algorithm in deep learning models. It was developed mainly to address the diminishing learning rates in the conventional Gradient Descent algorithm. It optimizes the learning rate parameter adaptively for different parameters. RMSprop is robust and capable of working with both non-stationary and noisy objectives, enabling a smooth and efficient trajectory towards the optimal weights during model training, thus speeding up the learning process and improving the model's performance.

<HISTORY>
RMSprop Optimizer was introduced by Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in deep learning and neural networks, during his Neural Networks course on Coursera. It was not a part of any published scientific research paper but gained popularity through the course and its recommended use. RMSprop was designed to optimize the issues that arose with AdaGrad's approach to adaptive learning rates. While AdaGrad tended to decrease the learning rate too aggressively, RMSprop introduced a decay factor to give more weight to the recent gradients.

<KEY IDEAS>
RMSprop operates by maintaining a moving (discounted) average of the square of gradients and dividing the gradient by the root of this average. This method is a gradient descent with adaptive learning rates and is very efficient at navigating for complex topologies. The principle in RMSprop is to utilize the magnitude of the recent gradient descents to normalize the gradient. This avoids aggressive, rapid reductions in the learning rate and ensures improved convergence. RMSprop uses a smoothing parameter which helps in preventing division by zero errors and helps to stabilize the optimization process.

<VARIATIONS>
Even though RMSprop has been known for its effectiveness, certain variations and improvements have been proposed. One such variation is the Adam Optimizer (Adaptive moment estimation). Adam combines the benefits of two extensions of stochastic gradient descent: RMSprop and AdaGrad, by performing adaptive learning rate optimization like RMSprop and storing each squared gradient's effective value like AdaGrad. This combination makes Adam an efficient algorithm for deep learning optimization.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
RMSprop has been widely applied in different deep learning algorithms, particularly in situations dealing with non-stationary objectives. It helps in optimizing the weights and ensures adequate and timely learning. It plays a vital role in demanding objectives like training deep and complex neural networks, including those used in convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Given its efficiency in noisy and diverse environments, it is chosen for optimization problems where there are a lot of shifting variables and fluctuating data points. In addition to applications in machine learning and deep learning models, RMSprop is also used in training reinforcement learning models.
