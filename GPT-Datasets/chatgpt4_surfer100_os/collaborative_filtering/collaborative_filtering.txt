<INTRODUCTION>
Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a popular technique utilized by recommendation systems such as those employed by Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify, among others. The technology relies on user behavior, habits, and interests to suggest new items or products. The recommendations generated by CF are computed based on the data collected from past behaviors of similar users. The driving assumption is that individuals who agreed in the past are likely to agree again in the future. The approach is solely based on past interactions and does not rely on any additional information.

<HISTORY>
Collaborative Filtering first emerged in the 1990s as a method for making recommendations, through early prototypes of recommendation systems. The Tapestry system, created by Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), was one of the first systems to introduce CF, manually clustering articles based on user ratings. In 1994, the concept was automated with the GroupLens system by a research team at the University of Minnesota. This was then popularized by Amazon and Netflix, with Netflix famously holding the Netflix Prize competition in 2006 to improve its recommendation engine.

<KEY IDEAS>
Collaborative Filtering operates on the fundamental assumption that users who have agreed in the past are likely to agree again in the future. There are two major types of Collaborative Filtering: User-based (or user-user) and Item-based (or item-item) Collaborative Filtering. In user-user CF, recommendations are based on users who are similar in their preferences to the target user. On the other hand, item-item CF works by comparing, for each user, the items rated by that user to the item under consideration, finding the most similar items and producing a rating. The similarity between items or users is usually evaluated using similarity metrics like Pearson correlation or cosine similarity.

<VARIATIONS>
There are some valuable variations and extensions to Collaborative Filtering. One such variation is Matrix Factorization, a model-based variant of CF that factorizes the user-item interaction matrix into latent feature vectors, allowing for a more scalable and precise prediction process. Another is Hybrid Collaborative Filtering, combining the strengths of both collaborative and content-based filtering by incorporating user/item profiles into the collaborative filtering models. Additionally, recent advancement of deep learning has fueled further development of Collaborative Filtering models, evolving more complex architectures for capturing complex patterns within data.

<APPLICATIONS>
The application of Collaborative Filtering extends far beyond just e-commerce or media streaming services. Anywhere that personalized recommendations can enhance user experience or business outcomes, from social media platforms, news websites, to job recruitment sites, Collaborative Filtering techniques can be found. It can be used for recommending products, movies, music, news, books, and even people (in the case of dating websites or social networks). Real-world examples include Amazon's product suggestions, LinkedIn's job recommendations, and Spotify's playlist generation.
