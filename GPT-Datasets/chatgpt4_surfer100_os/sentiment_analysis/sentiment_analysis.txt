<INTRODUCTION>
Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information from source materials. It aims to determine the attitudes, opinions, and emotions of a speaker or writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. This approach can be productively applied to social media, reviews, blogs, and other forms of user-generated content where users express their opinions about products, services, and topics.

<HISTORY>
Sentiment Analysis has a rich history, sparked by the early work of linguists and computer scientists in the field of natural language processing in the 1950s and 60s. The significant growth of user-generated content in the late 1990s and early 2000s prompted a more active research interest. An early application of sentiment analysis tackled the task of classifying movie reviews as positive or negative. Through the years, Sentiment Analysis has evolved, making use of refined techniques and sophisticated algorithms for better understanding nuances in language.

<KEY IDEAS>
Sentiment Analysis involves identifying subjective information and classifying it into positive, negative, or neutral categories by analyzing textual data. There are three main levels of sentiment analysis: document level, sentence level, and aspect level. Document-level analysis considers the whole document as a basic information unit, while the sentence-level analysis focuses on sentences. Aspect level analysis goes deeper and analyses sentiments towards various aspects within the text. Techniques used in Sentiment Analysis include machine learning, lexicon-based methods, and hybrid approaches. 

<VARIATIONS>
Over time, a bundle of techniques and variations of basic sentiment analysis was proposed. Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) goes beyond general sentiment analysis by not only identifying emotions but also identifying their targets or aspects. Multi-domain sentiment analysis helps in various verticals where words carry different sentiment polarities. Emotion detection, a sub-field of sentiment analysis, attempts to detect specific emotions like excitement, fear, or anger instead of categorizing text as positive, negative, or neutral. 

<APPLICATIONS>
Sentiment Analysis has broad applications across various domains. In business, it’s widely used to understand customer sentiment towards products, services, or brand which helps in decision making. In politics, it’s used to gauge public opinion towards policies or candidates. It’s also used in predictive analysis, for instance, predicting stock market trends based on public sentiment. Providers of analytics services, social media platforms, and customer service tools often integrate sentiment analysis into their software to provide real-time analysis of customer feedback. Over and above, it’s also used in social sciences for research purposes.
