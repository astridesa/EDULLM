<INTRODUCTION>
"Decision Boundary" plays a vital role in the field of machine learning and statistics, separating input data into classes based on a set of learned characteristics. It can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the complexity and nature of the dataset. Decision boundaries determine the classification of new instances or observations, based on their position in relation to the boundaries. They allow us to visualize the complexity and performance of classifiers. Various classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees and neural networks, work by defining distinct decision boundaries.

<HISTORY>
The notion of "Decision Boundary" has been around since the early application of statistical concepts to decision theory. As machine learning and pattern recognition have evolved, so, too, has the importance of understanding and utilizing decision boundaries. The history of decision boundaries in machine learning is intrinsically tied with the development of different algorithms. As algorithms have advanced in complexity, so has the concept of the decision boundary - evolving from linear separations to incredibly intricate, multi-dimensional spaces.

<KEY IDEAS>
The decision boundary is determined by the classifier during the training phase. It separates the feature space into various sections, each belonging to a specific class. A linear decision boundary, produced by algorithms like Logistic Regression and Linear SVM, is a simple straight line, plane or hyperplane. In contrast, Non-linear decision boundaries, resulting from complex algorithms like Kernel SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, can have many different shapes. These boundaries exemplify how the classifier is predicting the class labels. Understanding these boundaries helps in assessing the classifier's performance and tweaking the complexity of the model to avoid overfitting or underfitting. 

<VARIATIONS>
Different classification algorithms establish different types of decision boundaries. For instance, Logistic Regression produces a linear decision boundary, while a Decision Tree creates hierarchical decision boundaries. Furthermore, while Support Vector Machines primarily establish linear decision boundaries, with the use of kernel trick, they can also create non-linear boundaries. Similarly, many neural network architectures, with their complexity and multi-layer design, can devise complex non-linear decision boundaries. The use of different algorithms, and accordingly, different decision boundaries depend on the problem at hand and the nature of the dataset. 

<APPLICATIONS>
Understanding decision boundaries is crucial in many real-world applications in various sectors including healthcare, finance, and marketing. In healthcare, it can assist in classifying different types of diseases based on distinct sets of symptoms. In finance, it can help segregate risky investments from safe ones. In marketing, it can classify customer behavior for targeted advertisements. Moreover, in image recognition, intricate decision boundaries can be established to differentiate complex patterns. Visualization of these boundaries also assists in understanding and refining the algorithms for better model performance and predictions.
