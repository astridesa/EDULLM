<INTRODUCTION>
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a field of machine learning focused on the task of translating from one human language to another. The goal is to create computational models that can understand and interpret linguistic structures, translating the meaning of a sentence, rather than just translating words individually. Unlike traditional translation methods, that relied on complex, handcrafted linguistic rules, NMT trains deep neural networks to learn these rules automatically, resulting in more accurate and natural-sounding translations.
 
<HISTORY>
The history of NMT lies in the mid-2010s, pioneered primarily by universities and technology companies. The initial exploration was prompted by the shortcomings of older, phrases-based machine translation (PBMT) systems. NMT came into prominence due to its ability to learn complex language representations and translate complete sentences in a more cohesive manner. Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) system launched in 2016 marked a notable point in the development and awareness of NMT, showcasing significant advancements in the quality and fluency of machine translation.
 
<KEY IDEAS>
The foundational concept in NMT is the representation of words and sentences as continuous vectors in high-dimensional space. This representation allows the network to learn semantic and syntactic relationships between words. Typically, a NMT system uses an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder processes the input language, converts it into semantically rich vectors called "context vectors", which is then passed on to the decoder which generates the translation in the target language. End-to-End learning and the ability to handle long-range dependencies between words are among the key features of NMT.

<VARIATIONS>
Several variations and improvements on the basic NMT model have been proposed. Attention mechanisms, designed to improve the handling of long sentences, are among the most notable. Attention allows the model to focus on different parts of the input for each word of the output, improving the coherence of translations. Another variant is the Transformer model, replacing standard recurrent layers with self-attention mechanisms, reducing computation time and improving the overall model's scalability. Transformer-based models, like Google's BERT and OpenAI's GPT-3, have set new performance standards in machine translation and other NLP tasks.
 
<APPLICATIONS>
NMT has been successfully applied to numerous real-world translation tasks, both spoken and text-based. Major tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook have integrated NMT into their translation services, vastly improving their ability to accurately and fluently translate text. Other applications include multilingual customer support, cross-language information retrieval and real-time translation of online chats or social media content. Additionally, the techniques developed for NMT are also applicable more broadly across natural language processing, for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text summarization and question answering.
