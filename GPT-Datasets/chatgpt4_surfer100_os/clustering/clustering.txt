<INTRODUCTION>
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that involves the grouping of data points or objects that are similar to each other. In essence, the main aim of this method is to partition a data set into subsets or clusters in such a way that data points in the same cluster are more related to each other by a given metric than to those in other clusters. Clustering helps to understand the structure of data, and to identify hidden patterns in data. It's widely used in various fields such as data mining, image processing, customer segmentation and bioinformatics.

<HISTORY>
The notion of clustering has been used in several disciplines since the late 19th century, but the formal algorithmic approach to clustering begun in the late 1950s with the developments of taxonomies and hierarchies. In 1957, Robert Sokal, an evolutionary biologist, pioneered the use of clustering techniques in taxonomy. Over the subsequent years, numerous clustering methods have been developed, enhanced and tailored for use in a variety of applications. Some of these include hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, DBSCAN among others.

<KEY IDEAS>
There are several key ideas that underline clustering techniques. Primarily, clustering algorithms aim to partition data points into distinct groups based on their similarity. These clusters should ideally have high intra-cluster similarity meaning elements within a cluster are very similar, and low inter-cluster similarity indicating elements from different clusters are distinct. Different clustering algorithms focus on different types of data and similarity measure. The K-Means algorithm for instance, works best on numerical datasets and uses the Euclidean distance as its similarity measure. Other algorithms like Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering can work with a variety of data types and similarity measures.

<VARIATIONS>
Several variants of clustering techniques exist based on the nature of the dataset and the requirement of the application. Hierarchical clustering, for instance, constructs a hierarchy or binary tree of clusters where each node is a cluster consisting of the clusters of its children nodes. The two main types of hierarchical clustering include Agglomerative (bottom up approach) and Divisive (top down approach). K-means clustering partition data into 'K' non-overlapping subsets or clusters without any cluster-internal structure. Density-based clustering like DBSCAN is designed to discover arbitrary-shaped clusters and to handle noise in spatial datasets.

<APPLICATIONS>
The applications of clustering are broad and varied. In customer segmentation, clustering is used to find segments of customers with similar behavior. In bioinformatics, it's used to classify proteins with similar functionality in the same cluster. In image processing, clustering is used for pattern recognition, image segmentation and object recognition. Clustering is also essential for document clustering in text mining, for instance, for news clustering or topic extraction. Other applications include anomaly detection, where "strange" or "unusual" data instances are identified, and recommendation systems, where clusters could help to find similar preferences or tastes.
