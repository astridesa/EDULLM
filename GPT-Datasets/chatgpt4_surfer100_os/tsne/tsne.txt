<INTRODUCTION>
t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a machine learning algorithm for visualization developed by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoff Hinton. It is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. It converts similarities between data points to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probabilities of the low-dimensional embedding and the high-dimensional data. t-SNE has a cost function that is not convex, i.e., with different initializations we can get different results.

<HISTORY>
t-SNE was introduced by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoff Hinton in 2008 as a technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well-suited for the visualization of high-dimensional data. The technique grew out of an earlier algorithm called SNE (Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) developed by Hinton and Roweis in 2002. The addition of the t-distribution in the newer algorithm improved the visualization by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map.

<KEY IDEAS>
t-SNE employs a probabilistic approach to model the similarity between points in high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces. It constructs a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar objects have a higher probability of being picked, while dissimilar points have an extremely small likelihood of being picked. It then creates a similar probability distribution over the points in the low-dimensional map, and it minimizes the divergence between the two distributions with respect to the locations of the points in the map. It should be noted that while t-SNE is visually compelling, it comes with its own set of limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results.

<VARIATIONS>
While t-SNE is a powerful tool for visualizing high-dimensional data, the algorithm does have a few limitations. To address these, various extensions and modifications of t-SNE algorithm have been proposed. Parametric t-SNE introduces an additional parametric mapping from the data space to the map space to overcome the scalability limitations of t-SNE. To address the consistency issue, Barnes-Hut-SNE uses an approximation to the standard t-SNE, resulting in an algorithm that can handle larger data sets. Another noteworthy variation is the LargeVis, which is designed for visualizing very large-scale data.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
t-SNE has been widely used in a variety of applications especially in the field of data science and machine learning. It has been particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional datasets in fields like bioinformatics for gene expression and protein folding, image processing for digit recognition, and Natural Language Processing for semantic word embeddings. Furthermore, t-SNE is often used in the exploratory phase of machine learning workflows to analyse data distributions and patterns. Despite having certain drawbacks such as computational cost and interpretability, its ability to create intuitive scatter plots in two or three dimensions makes it a preferred choice for high-dimensional data visualization.
