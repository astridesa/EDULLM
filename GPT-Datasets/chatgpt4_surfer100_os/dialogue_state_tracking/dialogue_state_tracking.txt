<INTRODUCTION>
Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is a crucial component of conversational AI, specifically in task-oriented dialogue systems. It revolves around keeping track of the dialogue's state, i.e., understanding the user's intent and the information being discussed during a conversation. This is primarily utilized in personal assistants, chatbots, recommendation systems etc. DST helps them engage in more focused, productive dialogues and deliver accurate responses. In essence, DST allows a dialogue system to comprehend and remember the ongoing conversation's context, setting the stage for meaningful interactions.

<HISTORY>
DST's inception is closely tied to the evolution of dialogue systems. Traditional methods for DST involved rule-based systems, wherein each user utterance was matched with predefined patterns. In the late 2000s, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) was introduced for DST, where uncertainties in understanding user input were handled via belief states. With the rise of deep learning, neural network-based models came into play around 2015, marking a significant leap in DST's performance and capabilities. 

<KEY IDEAS>
DST works on the premise of comprehending and maintaining context within a conversation. Key ideas in early systems featured rule-based and statistical methods, but recent advancements employ machine learning solutions, including deep learning models. Several approaches exist today, such as the generative, discriminative, and hybrid models. An essential aspect of DST is handling uncertainties in the conversation by maintaining belief states or probability distributions over all possible states. This allows the system to effectively tackle incorrect or ambiguous inputs, resulting in more flexible and robust dialogue systems.

<VARIATIONS>
There are several variations within DST based on their design and techniques employed. Generative models directly generate the dialogue state from utterances, while discriminative models classify user inputs into predefined states. Hybrid models combine both these methods. Another variant is the Dialogue State Tracker Challenge (DSTC) series, essentially competitions aimed to promote the development of novel DST algorithms. More recently, there's a shift towards end-to-end neural network-based models which combine multiple dialogue system components, including DST, into a single model.

<APPLICATIONS>
DST plays a pivotal role in a variety of applications primarily within conversational AI systems. These include virtual personal assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, where DST enables these systems to comprehend user's intents over a conversation. It also finds application in customer service chatbots, helping them to accurately respond to customer queries based on the ongoing dialogue's context. Additionally, DST is utilized in recommendation systems, automated phone systems, and teaching systems, enhancing their abilities to maintain and utilize the context in dialogues effectively.
