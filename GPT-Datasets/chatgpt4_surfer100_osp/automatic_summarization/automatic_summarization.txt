<INTRODUCTION>
Automatic summarization is a method within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves the generation of short, condensed versions of longer documents while retaining their essential meanings and information. Predominantly used to streamline the process of information extraction and comprehension, automatic summarization works in various ways with the primary aim of reducing reading time without losing the crux of the information. The motivation behind its creation is to harness the capability of machines to read and understand human language automatically in an efficient and meaningful manner. 

<HISTORY>
The concept of automatic summarization was first introduced in the late 1950s by H.P. Edmundson with his article "New Methods in Automatic Extracting". He argued that machine summarization could potentially augment human ability to process large amounts of text, particularly in professional settings where time and information management are critical. Its development gets the spotlight amidst the proliferating volume of information and the need to assist people in keeping the massive flow manageable and understandable.

<KEY IDEAS>
The core idea of automatic summarization is the identification and extraction of the most relevant and significant information within a text. This is often done using two main approaches: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization involves pulling key phrases or sentences directly from the text and compiling them into a summary. On the other hand, abstractive summarization involves understanding the text's content and reformulating the ideas in a concise way, much like how a human would summarize a text. Both of these methods focus on retaining the crux of the information while reducing redundancy and fluff.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
Automatic summarization finds a wide range of applications including AI-enabled news summarization, generating product reviews summary, condensing scientific research for easier understanding, creating executive summaries in businesses, summarizing medical records, and assisting in digital libraries. In recent years, automatic summarization capabilities also play a critical role in voice assistants, chatbots, and other customer-related services, helping in gaining quick insights and information extraction from large volumes of text data.

<VARIATIONS>
There are various models and techniques within automatic summarization sphere that considers structure, style, and length of the summary. Beyond extractive and abstractive summarization, other methods like topic-focused, query-based, multi-document summarization have emerged. The automatic summarization is a subfield of a larger NLP domain, which also encompasses related tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and others. The common goal of all these models, tasks, and techniques is to understand, utilise and generate human languages, ultimately contributing to the field of artificial intelligence.
