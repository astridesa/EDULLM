<INTRODUCTION>
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a statistical model used primarily in the field of machine learning and data analysis. Part of the broader category of Markov chain models, HMMs offer a way to describe the evolution of observable events that are driven by an internal state which is not directly accessible. The model's effectiveness has found it a important role in numerous applications, ranging from image recognition, speech recognition, genomics to finance. The primary motivation behind HMMs is to provide a framework to infer the missing information from observable data, where every state from the hidden sequence generates an output according to a certain probability distribution related to that state.

<HISTORY>
The concept of HMMs was first introduced in the late 1960s by L.E Baum and his collaborators, as they sought to create effective models for understanding speech patterns. With its primary use in the area of speech recognition, HMMs provided a solution to the challenge of connecting unobservable phenomena (like mental states or hidden linguistic structure) to observable data (like speech sound or written text). Over the years, HMMs have been refined and expanded upon to tackle broader data interpretation tasks.

<KEY IDEAS>
The essential idea underpinning HMMs is the use of observed data to infer latent or hidden states within a system. Within the model, each hidden state has a probability of transitioning to another state, including potentially transitioning back to itself. Corresponding to each state is a set of observable outcomes, the likelihood of each being determined by a probability density function tied to that state. The sequences of observables generated by real-world processes are then instances of outputs from certain hidden sequences of states, allowing us to make educated guesses about the hidden nature of the system using statistical analysis.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
HMMs have found utility in a diverse range of applications. The method has been pivotal in the development of automated speech recognition systems. Geneticists use HMMs in bioinformatics to predict gene locations in a DNA sequence. The finance sector utilizes HMM to analyze temporal stock-market data, observing patterns, predicting trends, and making investment decisions. Weather forecasting, handwriting recognition, and computer vision are among the list of applications.

<VARIATIONS>
Several variations and extensions of the traditional HMM exist. The most common one is the Continuous State HMM where the hidden state is not restricted to a finite set, but may assume continuous values. Other variations include Input-output HMMs, Semi-Markov Models, Dynamic Bayesian Networks, and Pair HMMs. Each of these variations tweaks some aspects of the original HMM, making them more suitable for different sets of tasks. These models together form a broader field of sequential data modeling and temporal pattern recognition.
