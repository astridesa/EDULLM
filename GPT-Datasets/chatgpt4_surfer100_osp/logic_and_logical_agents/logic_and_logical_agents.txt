<INTRODUCTION>
Logic and logical agents are a key component of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the subfield of knowledge representation and reasoning. Logical agents apply inference rules to derive new knowledge from given facts. The concept of logical agents is a cornerstone in fields such as computer science, cognitive science, mathematics, and philosophy. They serve to eliminate ambiguity and improve understanding, thereby allowing computers to solve a variety of problems and tasks, from query answering to expert systems, among others.

<HISTORY>
The roots of logic date back to the ancient Greeks, particularly Aristotle. However, logical agents have their roots in the mid-20th century with the emergence of computers and artificial intelligence. Notably, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the work of John McCarthy on the Advice Taker laid the foundation for the logic-based systems in artificial intelligence. His work focused on designing a system that could perform inference-based reasoning similar to human logic, thus addressing the challenges of mechanical reasoning.

<KEY IDEAS>
Logical agents act according to the principle that belief decisions must be founded on logical deduction. These agents function based on traditional logic systems, such as propositional and first-order logic. Propositional logic provides a formal system for making inferences based on statements or propositions, while first-order logic extends propositional logic by adding quantifiers, relations, and functions. In a logical system, each sentence represents a fact. The rules of inference allow logical agents to infer new facts from given facts. Therefore, the correctness of inferences made by logical agents is heavily dependent on the completeness and soundness of the underlying logic.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
Logical agents find practical applications in various domains. For instance, in AI, they are used to create expert systems, which are computer systems that emulate the decision-making ability of human experts. Additionally, logical agents are used in automated theorem provers, which can verify the correctness of complex proofs, and in database systems, where logic-based queries are answered based on a set of facts. They are also applied in integrated circuit design, real-time control systems, and in numerous fields where problem solving based on deduction is required.

<VARIATIONS>
There are many variants of logical systems that could be applied in different contexts. To highlight a few, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) extend the logical agent concept to include communication, planning, and negotiation among agents. Temporal logic allows reasoning about sequences of events and their ordering. Modal logic extends propositional logic with the operators 'necessarily' and 'possibly' introducing the notion of possible worlds. Each variation offers unique solutions to different sets of problems in their respective domains, thus showcasing the breadth and versatility of logic in a wider framework of AI.
