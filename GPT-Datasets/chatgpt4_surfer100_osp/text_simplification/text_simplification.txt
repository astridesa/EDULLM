<INTRODUCTION>
Text Simplification, a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP), involves the process of clarifying text to increase readability and understandability. This research topic aims to enhance the application of digital technology, easing interactions with complex technical documents, scientific texts, learning materials for non-native speakers, and assistive technologies for individuals with cognitive impairments. Motivated by the increasing growth of information and the need to cater to diverse audiences, Text Simplification enables effective communication and comprehension of textual content.

<HISTORY>
Text Simplification originated back into the 1990s with the advent of Machine Translation and NLP advancements. It aimed to address the challenge of reducing linguistic complexity while retaining the original text's meaning. In 1954, the Automatic Readability Index was one of the first techniques introduced to quantify the readability of documents. Sidner (1972) later introduced the concept of Text Simplification as a pre-processing step for Machine Translation systems. Over the years, it has evolved to deal with advanced linguistic phenomena including lexical, syntactic, and discourse-level phenomena.

<KEY IDEAS>
The core premise of Text Simplification is reducing the complexity of a text, mainly broken down into Lexical Simplification and Syntactic Simplification. Lexical Simplification replaces complex words or phrases with simpler synonyms, while Syntactic Simplification breaks long, convoluted sentences into shorter ones. Text Simplification is a multi-faceted issue dealing with not only word and sentence transformation but also ensuring coherence and cohesion. More contemporary approaches employ machine learning techniques, models, and algorithms to automatically simplify textual content.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
Text Simplification finds a myriad of applications across various domains. It aids in enhancing readability of educational documents for young children or non-native English speakers, simplifying legal texts, scientific literature, and healthcare documentation for laymen understanding. Furthermore, it also caters to assistive technologies for people with cognitive disorders, like aphasia or dyslexia. It serves as a preprocessing step in language translation and in information extraction tasks to handle complex and compound sentences.

<VARIATIONS>
Text Simplification is part of a broader spectrum of simplification tasks, including Sentence Compression, Paraphrase Generation, and Text Summarization. Each presents a different angle and perspective to the aspect of simplification and clarity. Other related models and techniques – like statistical approaches, rule-based techniques, and neural simplification methods – contribute to an evolving landscape of this research topic. Moreover, Text Simplification belongs to the larger NLP umbrella that encompasses numerous related techniques to process and comprehend human language.
