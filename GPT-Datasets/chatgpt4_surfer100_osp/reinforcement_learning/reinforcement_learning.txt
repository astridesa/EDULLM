<INTRODUCTION>
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a prominent sub-area of machine learning that focuses on the training of machine based agents to take actions to maximize rewards in certain environment. This form of learning, which falls under the aegis of artificial intelligence (AI), is motivated by the way humans learn from their experiences. RL finds applications across various domains including game playing, robotics, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, and many more, due to its capability of learning from trial and error.

<HISTORY>
The concept of RL traces its origins back to the field of behavioral psychology in the 20th century. It was introduced to the realm of machine learning and AI by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto in 1980s. The method was primarily brought forth to solve problems involving sequential decision making. Its potential started gaining attention with the advent of Q-learning algorithm in 1989 and was advanced significantly with the DeepMind’s triumph over the traditional Go champion through their RL system, AlphaGo, in 2015.

<KEY IDEAS>
The principal idea in RL centers around the "agent", which interacts with its environment by taking actions, observing the feedback from the environment (reward), and learning through this process. There are three key components: the policy, which is the strategy that the agent employs to determine the action at a given state; the reward function, which gives immediate feedback on an action; and value function, which calculates what is the total amount of reward the agent can expect atleast from a state onwards. This trial and error learning procedure is iterative and continues until the agent’s performance does not improve significantly.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
Reinforcement learning has a plethora of applications. It is used in the world of gaming to create AI players such as AlphaGo. Autonomous driving greatly benefits from RL, with the AI learning to drive by constantly improving from prior experiences. In the realm of healthcare, RL algorithms assist in personalized treatment recommendations based on individual patient history. RL also finds substantial uses in domains like finance for portfolio management, in robotics for navigation and manipulation tasks, and in energy for optimizing consumption.

<VARIATIONS>
Numerous variations of RL have evolved over time. One key variant is deep reinforcement learning which combines deep learning and RL, utilizing neural networks to ‘learn’ directly from raw input data. Partially observable reinforcement learning is another type where the agent does not have complete information about the environment. Multi-agent reinforcement learning involves multiple agents learning simultaneously through interaction. Inverse reinforcement learning is a unique variation where the reward function is learnt from observed behavior. These variations further broaden the scope of RL and enable it to tackle more complex and diverse problems.
