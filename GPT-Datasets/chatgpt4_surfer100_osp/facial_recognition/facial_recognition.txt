<INTRODUCTION>
Facial Recognition is a biometric technology capable of identifying or verifying a person by comparing and analysing patterns based on the person's facial contours. It is a task in computer vision, a sub-field of artificial intelligence, where the goal is to train systems to interpret images. Its functionalities are used in various applications such as mobile security, advertising, law enforcement, and surveillance systems. The wide range of applications stems from the ability to understand and represent human faces mathematically and compare facial features in a database.

<HISTORY>
Facial Recognition is not a new technology as it originated in the 1960s by Woody Bledsoe, a pioneer in artificial intelligence. Then, it mainly involved the manual input of coordinates on a person's face. Bledsoe and his team's work focused on the problem of face recognition from the standpoint of pattern recognition, correlation, and estimation theory. Modern development began in the 1990s when the U.S began to invest in facial recognition technology for security purposes. The technology has seen rapid progress since the introduction of machine learning and convolutional neural networks.

<KEY IDEAS>
A key concept of facial recognition technology is the use of mathematical algorithms and deep learning models to map out a person's face. It works by capturing an image of an individual's face, converting it into a numerical representation and comparing it with faces within a database to find a match. Two main steps involve face detection (to locate any human faces in an image or video clip) and face recognition (comparison of detected face with the known faces). A key component of the recognition process is identifying unique features -like the distance between the eyes, the width of the nose, depth of the eye sockets, etc.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
Facial Recognition has a variety of applications. In the security industry, it's used in surveillance systems, identity verification and criminal identification. It's in widespread use in smartphone technology for unlocking devices and authorizing payments. In the healthcare sector, facial recognition can be used to monitor patients and in detecting genetic diseases. In advertising and retail, it's used to track consumer behaviour and preferences, helping businesses deliver personalized experiences.

<VARIATIONS>
Facial recognition is just one aspect of biometric technologies, which also include fingerprint recognition, iris scanning, voice identification, and gait analysis. Like facial recognition, these other biometric technologies share the same underlying principle of using unique biological characteristics for recognition procedure. Other relevant technologies would be 3D face recognition (which incorporates 3D sensors to capture information about the shape of a face), thermal cameras (for night time use), and skin texture analysis that use the visual details of the skin, as captured in standard digital or scanned images.
