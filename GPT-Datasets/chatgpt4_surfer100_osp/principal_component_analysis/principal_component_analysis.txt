<INTRODUCTION>
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure frequently used in fields including machine learning, computer vision and pattern recognition. It is a method of analyzing large data sets with the goal of identifying underlying variables or 'principal components' that explain most of the variance in the data. The applications of PCA are diverse with uses in fields from finance to biology. The procedure helps to simplify data sets, making them easier to explore and visualize by reducing the dimensions without much loss of information. 

<HISTORY>
First introduced by Karl Pearson in 1901, Principal Component Analysis was developed in the context of the need to analyze large amounts of data with many variables. The objective was to simplify the complexity of high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. Pearson's method was used to transform variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables which were ordered such that they retained most of the variability present in the original variables. The method dealt with the issue of multicollinearity in multiple regression, which had been a significant problem for statisticians.

<KEY IDEAS>
The core idea behind PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large number of interrelated variables while retaining as much variance in the data as possible. PCA does this by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, the principal components, which are uncorrelated and arranged in such a way that the first few retain most of the variation present in all of the original variables. These principal components are orthogonal, i.e., in direct opposition to each other in multi-dimensional space. The first principal component accounts for the most variance, the second account for the next most, and so on.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
PCA is widely used in various fields. In data analysis, it aids in understanding and visualizing high-dimensional data by reducing the number of dimensions. In machine learning, PCA is often used for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional data spaces where the number of features exceeds the number of observations. This helps to decrease model complexity and overfitting. In the field of computer vision, PCA is used for face recognition and image compression. In finance, it helps in reducing portfolios of correlated assets to a smaller set of uncorrelated portfolios.

<VARIATIONS>
There are variations and extensions to the basic PCA algorithm to accommodate different types of data and address several issues. Some popular variations include Kernel PCA, which applies a kernel function to the data before performing PCA; Sparse PCA, which introduces sparsity to the principal components making them more interpretable; Robust PCA, which is resistant to outliers in the dataset. These variations of PCA broaden its applicability and enhance its effectiveness in extracting meaningful information from high dimensional datasets. PCA fits into the larger picture of dimensionality reduction and feature extraction techniques, alongside other methods such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
