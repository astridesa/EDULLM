<INTRODUCTION>
Attention Mechanism is a significant operation in the Deep Learning subfield, particularly within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It enables the model to focus on specific input parts when producing an output, much like a human's selective attention ability. This concept has transformed the way neural networks process and understand vast volumes of information, particularly in machine translation, image captioning, speech recognition, and more, by creating a more efficient, nuanced approach.

<HISTORY>
The concept of Attention Mechanism was first introduced in the paper "Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate" in 2014 by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho and Yoshua Bengio. It was brought forth to improve the accuracy and performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) by resolving the bottleneck associated with fixed-length vector in sequence-to-sequence tasks. Thus, they devised an 'attention' method that allowed the model to look back at the source inputs through various time steps while decoding, optimising the translation process.

<KEY IDEAS>
The primary essence of Attention Mechanism lies in its ability to assign different attention or 'weights' to various inputs, enabling the model to focus more on critical inputs while producing output. Instead of compressing all information into a fixed size vector, the model learns to pay attention to specific parts of the input. It creates an 'attention score' linking each word in the input and output sequences. Afterward, softmax function is applied to these scores to obtain 'attention distribution', which essentially discerns the matching words in the source and target sequence, enhancing the model's interpretability.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
Attention Mechanism is predominantly employed in sequence-to-sequence tasks like Neural Machine Translation, where it dramatically improves the accuracy by aligning the translated words with their actual source. In addition, it aids Text Summarization by focusing on key sentences, and in Speech Recognition to align spoken words with their corresponding transcript. Apart from NLP, it also finds usage in Computer Vision tasks like Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering by selectively focusing on image regions when generating descriptive captions or answering.

<VARIATIONS>
There are numerous variations of Attention Mechanism, including, but not limited to, Self-Attention (or Intra-Attention), Soft and Hard Attention, and Global and Local Attention. Self-Attention uses the model's input to calculate attention, while Soft and Hard attention vary in the degree and type of focus assigned to the input regions. Global Attention considers all input elements when calculating the context vector, while Local Attention restricts it to a subset. Other attention-based models like Transformer architecture have garnered much attention in the field due to their potential in handling varied tasks in NLP.
