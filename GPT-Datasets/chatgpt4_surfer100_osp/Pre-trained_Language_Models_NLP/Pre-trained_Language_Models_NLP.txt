<INTRODUCTION>
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are machine learning models that were trained on a large text corpus before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. They are part of the NLP subfield known as representation learning. PLMs, such as BERT or GPT, are capable of leveraging prior knowledge mined from vast data to improve performance on various NLP tasks, creating what's called transfer learning. These models can generate representations serving as useful features for downstream applications such as sentiment analysis, translation, and question answering. 

<HISTORY>
The field of NLP has a rich history of addressing the challenge of linguistic ambiguity, relying initially on handcrafted rules. However, in the past decade or so, we have seen a paradigm shift towards statistical, data-driven methods like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) and with the rise of deep learning, the pre-training/fine-tuning approach emerged. The large-scale PLMs became possible with the combination of algorithmic advances, larger datasets, and rapid improvement of hardware technologies. The first such model, ELMo, was introduced in 2018 by researchers at the Allen Institute for AI, and shortly after OpenAI introduced GPT, and Google introduced BERT.

<KEY IDEAS>
The fundamental idea behind PLMs is to pre-train a deep learning model on an enormously large corpus of unlabeled text data with an unsupervised objective (e.g., predicting masked words in a sentence a.k.a masked language model), which captures a wide variety of linguistic features. The pre-trained model can then be fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks, allowing it to adapt the knowledge learned from the large corpus to the particularities of the task. This approach complements traditional supervised learning methods, in which models are trained explicitly to optimize for a specific task.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
PLMs are used in a myriad of NLP tasks. Machine translation, text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, text summarization, or question answering can be significantly improved by PLMs like BERT or GPT when fine-tuned on task-specific data. They are also used to assist in voice assistants, chatbots, and search engines, providing nuanced language understanding and tailored responses. 

<VARIATIONS>
There are several variations of PLMs, each with its unique architectures and pre-training objectives. Noteworthy models include BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), XLNet, RoBERTa, and ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models). For instance, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from the entire text, while GPT uses a transformer-based unidirectional language model. The difference between these models lies in their architecture (either autoregressive or autoencoding), the specific pre-training objective, and the amount of training data used. They all belong to a broader landscape of representation learning in NLP.
