<INTRODUCTION>
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an approach to machine translation that uses a large artificial neural network. It falls under the broader field of natural language processing (NLP), which investigates how computers can best interact with human language. NMT's central motivation is to create models capable of translating entire sentences in one go, retaining all the necessary contextual information throughout the process. This technology has had a significant impact on various applications such as real-time language translation in communication apps, website translation, and cross-language information retrieval.

<HISTORY>
Introduced in the early 2010s, Neural Machine Translation aimed to overcome limitations in traditional phrase-based machine translation (PBMT). PBMT struggled with naturalness and fluency of translation since it operated on a phrase level. When the sequence of words became too complex, it struggled to maintain the sentence's original meaning. However, NMT's introduction ushered in a new era for machine translation, leveraging the power of machine learning and deep learning models to improve translation quality significantly.

<KEY IDEAS>
The core principle of Neural Machine Translation lies in the application of artificial neural networks, particularly sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. These models leverage the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to capture the temporal dependencies in a sentence. The model consists of an encoder reading the input sentences and converting them into a sequence of context-sensitive vectors. A decoder then generates the translated sentence from these vectors. An attention mechanism further improves this process by allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each step of the output sequence generation.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
Neural Machine Translation has found wide-ranging applications. It has revolutionized the translation industry, powering tools like Google Translate and Microsoft Translator. These applications can translate full sentences with improved contextual meaning. NMT is also employed for real-time translation in communication apps, enhancing international collaborations. It's used in cross-platform information retrieval, enabling search across multiple languages. Additionally, it's applied in subtitling services, allowing for the rapid translation of multimedia content.

<VARIATIONS>
Aside from the standard seq2seq model used in Neural Machine Translation, several variations enhance the model's performance. Transformer models, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need", bypass recurrent layers and rely entirely on attention mechanisms, reducing computation time for long sequences. Another variation includes the Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence model which uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) instead of RNN in the encoder-decoder structure. This approach is more parallelisable which makes it faster. More recently, the integration of pre-trained models like BERT in NMT systems has shown to drastically improve the translation quality.
