<INTRODUCTION>
Multilingual BERT, often abbreviated as mBERT, is a transformer model designed for multiple languages tasks, and it is part of the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). mBERT is a part of Googleâ€™s BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) family, built with the ambition to understand the syntax of different languages and to make contextual relations between words. It is primarily driven by the idea of 'one model, many languages', and its most motivating aspect is the shared representation for different languages, thereby allowing for language-neutral NLP tasks.

<HISTORY>
mBERT was introduced by Google AI as an extension of BERT in 2018, aiming to deal with the challenges of multilingual language understanding and representation. Addressing the linguistic variance and complexity of multiple languages was a key problem that mBERT was created to confront. This model is trained similarly to the English BERT, but instead of training a separate model for each language, mBERT attempts to integrate the understanding of 104 languages into a single model.

<KEY IDEAS>
Like BERT, mBERT is based on transformer architecture, focusing on attention mechanisms and parallelizability. It pre-trains deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all languages. The uniqueness of mBERT lies in its application to multiple languages. This specific type of training allows it to create shared representations for syntactically or semantically similar words across different languages. One core concept behind mBERT is that it does not require distinct models for each language; it works on the idea of shared multilingual embeddings, leading to representation where different languages' embeddings should be close to each other if they are translations.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
mBERT is widely utilized for a multitude of NLP tasks that involve multiple languages, ranging from translation, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis to multilingual sentence classification, and question-answering systems. In particular, it has shown promising results on tasks involving languages with limited resources due to the inherent capacity of transfer learning in multilingual models.

<VARIATIONS>
There are several alternatives and variations to the mBERT model within multilingual NLP tasks. Examples include XLM (Cross-lingual Language Model) by Facebook, specifically designed for cross-lingual tasks; DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and cheaper version of BERT; and ALBERT (A Lite BERT) which employs factorized embedding parameterization and cross-layer parameter sharing to reduce model size. These models showcase the progression of multilingual understanding capabilities in NLP and how mBERT fits within a larger framework of language-agnostic models.
