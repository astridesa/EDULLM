<INTRODUCTION>
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a machine learning algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data. It is a part of dimensionality reduction techniques, often used in exploratory data analysis and visualization purposes. The concept of t-SNE is motivated by the need to transform complex, high-dimensional data into a two or three-dimensional space that can be visually interpreted. t-SNE works efficiently on reducing dimensions and adding interpretability to many types of data which makes it suitable for various applications including image processing, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.

<HISTORY>
t-SNE was introduced by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton in 2008. The algorithm was specifically designed to address the visualization of high-dimensional data. Before t-SNE, algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) were popular for dimensionality reduction. However, these algorithms often failed to capture the complex structures within high-dimensional data. t-SNE came as a solution to this problem by introducing a probability-based approach that preserves the local and global structures of the data during the dimensionality reduction process.

<KEY IDEAS>
One of the key ideas behind t-SNE is the conversion of high-dimensional Euclidean distances between data points into conditional probabilities representing similarities. In essence, t-SNE uses a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar objects are given high probability while dissimilar points have low probability. Then, for the low-dimensional counterparts, a similar probability distribution is created. The t-SNE algorithm minimizes the divergence between these two distributions with respect to the locations of the points in the low-dimensional map. For this process, t-SNE applies a symmetric SNE to correctly model the similarity of the joint probabilities.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
t-SNE is popularly used in data exploration, machine learning, and visualizing high-dimensional data. In Neuroscience, t-SNE is used to visualize the organization of neural networks. In genetics, it has been applied to visualize the gene expression data. In Natural Language Processing (NLP) t-SNE is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of word embedding for better visualization. Aside from these, t-SNE is used in a broad spectrum of fields including computer vision, document analysis, bioinformatics, and speech analysis.

<VARIATIONS>
Several variations of t-SNE have been developed over the years which include largeVis and UMAP. LargeVis uses a similar approach to t-SNE for visualizing big data, while UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is another dimensionality reduction technique that has been gaining popularity due to its scalability to larger datasets and better preservation of global structures. These variations create a larger picture of dimensionality reduction as a key practice in interpreting complex, high-dimensional data. t-SNE and its variations collectively emphasize the importance of data visualization in modern data analysis.
