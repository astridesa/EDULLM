<INTRODUCTION>
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of Artificial Intelligence algorithm utilized in unsupervised machine learning, part of the broader category of neural networks. These algorithms are utilized to generate new data instances that resemble your training data, such as creating realistic synthesized human faces or original images with certain characteristics. They were introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 and they function based on a system of two neural networks contesting each other in a zero-sum game.

<HISTORY>
The concept of Generative Adversarial Networks was introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his team at the University of Montreal in 2014. GANs were invented to address the challenge of generative modeling, which is the task of generating new data points that accurately reflect a given distribution. They proposed a new structure in which two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator work antagonistically, with the generator aiming to produce data that can deceive the discriminator, and the discriminator aiming to distinguish real data from the data generated by the generator.

<KEY IDEAS>
The key idea behind GANs is the concept of a zero-sum game between two neural networks. The first one, the generator, creates artificial data instances, aiming to pass them off as real examples. The second one, the discriminator, reviews the data instances, trying to determine whether each one is like the examples from the original dataset or not. In turn, the generator tries to trick the discriminator while taking the feedback into account to refine its model. This adversarial play continues until the discriminator canâ€™t distinguish real examples from the fakes, whereupon the generator has achieved its goal.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
GANs are used in a variety of applications such as generating examples of human speech, image synthesis, semantic image editing, creating photo-realistic images, creating art, video generation, 3D object generation, augmenting data for training machine learning models, and drug discovery. The distinct architecture of GANs makes it highly effective in these tasks, as it results in the generation of high-quality, realistic outputs that very closely resemble the actual data.

<VARIATIONS>
There exist numerous variations of the original GAN structure. Some of the variations include Conditional GANs (cGANs) that can generate data with certain predetermined characteristics, Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) designed to make the training phase deeper and more successful, and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) aimed at improving stability during training. There are also other types of models inspired by the GAN structure, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which have similar capabilities and applications. This underlines the impact GANs have had on the field of machine learning and AI, continually evolving to solve more complex problems and enhance efficiency.
