<INTRODUCTION>
Information Retrieval (IR) is a significant part of computer science which tackles the organization and retrieval of information from a large and ever-growing data set. IR is crucial for search engines, online databases, and more. The primary idea is to assist users in finding the relevant and precise information they want amidst large volumes of data. This is accomplished using a model or set of algorithms that better understands the underlying semantics of the data and brings forward the most relevant results. 

<HISTORY>
The concept of Information Retrieval emerged with the need to manage, organize and access the growing wealth of information, especially in the onset of digital devices and the internet. In the early days of computing, IR systems faced challenges due to a lack of sophisticated methods and were highly dependent on manual coding and organization. However, with Gerard Salton’s introduction of the Vector Space Model in the 1960s and the subsequent development of TF-IDF weighting scheme, a significant milestone was made in the automation of IR systems. The progression and growth of the internet led to the development of new IR models and systems to handle web pages and hyperlinks, such as Google’s PageRank algorithm.

<KEY IDEAS>
The crux of Information Retrieval lies in fetching relevant data from a large data set - this may involve documents, database records, or other types of data sources. Various models are used for this, with the Boolean Model, Vector Space Model, and probabilistic models being the most common. The Boolean Model is based on set theory and uses Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), but lacks the ability to rank results. The Vector Space Model represents documents and queries as vectors in a multi-dimensional space and calculates cosine similarity for relevancy. The probabilistic models infer the probability of relevance based on the occurrence of words within the document.

<USES/APPLICATIONS>
The most common application of Information Retrieval is search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo, which retrieve web pages relevant to a user's query. It is also heavily used in databases to fetch relevant records and in digital libraries for accessing scholarly articles. In the modern context, IR is applied in E-Commerce sites to recommend relevant products, in News Applications to push relevant news to the readers, and even in email filters to classify and segregate Spam emails.

<VARIATIONS>
Different variations of Information Retrieval models have been developed over time to handle different forms of data. The Zone Scoring Model is an extended version of the vector model that offers more weight to the title and abstract of documents. The Fuzzy Set Model and Extended Boolean Model aim to tackle the strictness of boolean model. The Language Model and Divergence from Randomness model turn the retrieval problem into a prediction problem, calculating the probability that a random text generator model could generate the query words. These variations show how Information Retrieval adapts to different scenarios and leads to its expansion in different areas of computer science.
